# AstroHealth

AstroHealth is a space medical monitoring dashboard for astronaut Adam during a full mission lifecycle. It presents mission telemetry, health risk analysis, medical recommendations, chatbot support, body-zone highlighting, and a normalized health profile chart for the selected mission phase.

The project is currently an offline prototype. It uses JSON data and a PHP API layer to simulate future AI-powered medical monitoring without requiring MySQL or a real AI model yet.

Taqwa.... u have to i mean u must understand data-schema.json file ... why?? to return the same fields :/

so the ai-ready infrastructure  + if you have any feedback => let Anas know :/

u have to i mean u must understand data-schema.json file ... why?? to return the same fields :/

the most important file for u is api/chatbot.php + api/risk_predict.php so u have to understand it...

To be clear,, this project isnt exceptional cuz u will likely face stiff competition + If the focus in this competitionnn is on how the project is created or how it running, then its fairly gooddd. anywayy if the priority is the output and visual presentation, this project currently needs to add SUPERb features. :/

pls delete this message wHeN you finish ur work.../



## Project Idea

AstroHealth helps a mission medical team explain Adam's health state across key spaceflight phases:

- Earth baseline
- Pre-launch check
- Launch stress
- Zero gravity
- Exercise neglect
- Solar radiation storm
- Mental health isolation
- Landing preparation
- Rehabilitation

Each phase includes vital signs, alert status, AI-style reasoning, medical recommendations, chatbot messaging, body-zone highlighting, and chart data.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- JSON
- XAMPP Apache

Current project constraints:

- No React
- No Node.js app runtime
- No MySQL yet
- No real AI integration yet

## How To Run With XAMPP

1. Place the project folder at:

   ```text
   C:\xampp\htdocs\AstroHealth
   ```

2. Start Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Open the dashboard:

   [http://localhost:8080/AstroHealth](http://localhost:8080/AstroHealth)

If your Apache port is different, adjust the URL to match your local XAMPP configuration.

 note: please pay attention to this pointtttt :/

## API Contract

All APIs return JSON and read from `data-schema.json` for the current offline prototype.

### `api/telemetry_get.php`

Returns the full project schema.

Example:

```http
GET /AstroHealth/api/telemetry_get.php
```

Response includes:

- `project`
- `schema_version`
- `astronaut`
- `phase_order`
- `mission_phases`

This endpoint is used by the frontend to load the mission phase index and local phase data.

### `api/phase_get.php?phase_id=...`

Returns one mission phase object. This endpoint now tries MySQL first through `api/config.php`, then safely falls back to `data-schema.json` if MySQL is unavailable or the requested phase cannot be fully assembled from database records.

Example:

```http
GET /AstroHealth/api/phase_get.php?phase_id=zero_gravity
```

Success response includes the full phase object, including:

- `phase_id`
- `phase_title`
- `alert_level`
- `heart_rate`
- `blood_pressure`
- `oxygen_level`
- `radiation_level`
- `sleep_hours`
- `bone_density`
- `exercise_status`
- `mental_status`
- `ai_prediction`
- `ai_reasoning`
- `medical_recommendation`
- `chatbot_message`
- `highlighted_body_zone`
- `highlighted_body_zones`
- `color_status`
- `telemetry_chart`
- `data_source`, either `mysql` or `json_fallback`

Error responses:

- `400` if `phase_id` is missing
- `404` if `phase_id` is invalid
- `500` if `data-schema.json` is missing or invalid

### `api/risk_predict.php`

Returns a clean AI-like risk analysis response using current rule-based placeholder logic.

Example:

```http
GET /AstroHealth/api/risk_predict.php?phase_id=solar_radiation_storm
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "source": "rule_based_placeholder",
  "phase_id": "solar_radiation_storm",
  "risk_level": "emergency",
  "predicted_problem": "Acute radiation exposure risk.",
  "reasoning": "Radiation level has exceeded emergency threshold and stress markers are elevated.",
  "recommended_action": "Move to the radiation shelter, limit exposure time, pause nonessential tasks, and monitor nausea, headache, and fatigue.",
  "highlighted_body_zones": ["head", "chest"]
}
```

Compatibility aliases are also included for current frontend/test code:

- `alert_level`
- `ai_engine`
- `ai_prediction`
- `ai_reasoning`
- `highlighted_body_zone`
- `medical_recommendation`

Error responses:

- `400` if `phase_id` is missing
- `404` if `phase_id` is invalid
- `500` if `data-schema.json` is missing or invalid

### `api/chatbot.php`

Returns a clean chatbot response using current rule-based placeholder logic.

Example:

```http
POST /AstroHealth/api/chatbot.php
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phase_id": "mental_health_isolation",
  "user_message": "I feel lonely and tired"
}
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "source": "rule_based_placeholder",
  "detected_emotion": "mental_health_stress",
  "confidence_score": 0.92,
  "response_chatbot": "Adam, I hear you. You are not alone. Let us slow the next minute down: breathe in for four seconds, breathe out for six, and send one short status note to mission control.",
  "environment_control_trigger": {
    "change_lighting_color": "#FF8C00",
    "play_background_sound": "earth_rain.mp3"
  }
}
```

Error responses:

- `400` if the request body is not valid JSON
- `400` if `phase_id` is missing
- `400` if `phase_id` or `user_message` is not a string
- `404` if `phase_id` is invalid
- `405` if the request method is not `POST`
- `500` if `data-schema.json` is missing or invalid

## Frontend Data Flow

The dashboard uses `script.js` to load data in this order:

1. Try PHP API endpoints through XAMPP/Apache.
2. Use `api/telemetry_get.php` to load the mission phase list.
3. Use `api/phase_get.php?phase_id=...` when a phase is selected.
4. If PHP fails, fall back to local `data-schema.json`.
5. If local JSON fails, use the built-in frontend fallback object.

This keeps the dashboard working during presentations even if Apache or PHP has a temporary issue.

## Future Taqwa AI Integration

`api/risk_predict.php` and `api/chatbot.php` are prepared for future real AI integration.

Current behavior:

- Both files use `source: "rule_based_placeholder"`.
- Risk prediction is generated from existing phase data in `data-schema.json`.
- Chatbot emotion detection is simple keyword-based logic.
- Everything runs offline.

Future plan:

- Replace the placeholder functions in `risk_predict.php` and `chatbot.php` with calls to Taqwa's real AI model.
- The real AI model may run as a Python script, local service, or later backend service.
- Keep the same JSON response format so the frontend does not need to change.
- Keep `phase_id`, risk fields, chatbot fields, and body-zone fields stable.

Important frontend contract to preserve:

- `risk_predict.php` should continue returning `risk_level`, `predicted_problem`, `reasoning`, `recommended_action`, and `highlighted_body_zones`.
- `chatbot.php` should continue returning `detected_emotion`, `confidence_score`, `response_chatbot`, and `environment_control_trigger`.

## Future MySQL Database Plan

The project now includes a prepared MySQL schema at `database/schema.sql` for Anas to use later. This schema is not connected to the current app yet.

Current behavior:

- The dashboard still works from `data-schema.json`.
- The PHP API still reads JSON and returns the same responses as before.
- No MySQL connection is required to run the project.
- `api/config.php` provides a reusable PDO connection helper for future backend work, but current API endpoints do not depend on it yet.

Future plan:

- MySQL will store Adam's astronaut profile and baseline data.
- MySQL will store mission phase records and flight biometric logs.
- MySQL will store AI prediction history from `risk_predict.php`.
- MySQL will store chatbot messages, detected emotions, confidence scores, and environment-control triggers from `chatbot.php`.

Prepared tables:

- `astronauts`
- `mission_phases`
- `biometrics`
- `ai_predictions`
- `chatbot_logs`

When database integration begins, keep the existing API response formats stable so the frontend continues working while the backend source changes from JSON to MySQL.

### Create The Database In phpMyAdmin

1. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Open phpMyAdmin:

   [http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin](http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin)

   If phpMyAdmin uses a different Apache port on your machine, adjust the URL.

3. Click **New** in the left sidebar.
4. Create a database named:

   ```text
   astrohealth
   ```

5. Use collation:

   ```text
   utf8mb4_unicode_ci
   ```

### Import The Database Files

Import the files in this order:

1. Select the `astrohealth` database in phpMyAdmin.
2. Go to the **Import** tab.
3. Import:

   ```text
   database/schema.sql
   ```

4. After the schema import succeeds, import:

   ```text
   database/seed.sql
   ```

`schema.sql` creates the future tables. `seed.sql` inserts Adam, the 9 mission phases, phase biometrics, placeholder AI predictions, and placeholder chatbot messages.

see, i do it = create table + experimental data.

ANy way, be carefull cuz the schema.sql file have create tables info, but seed.sql have experimental data :/

SOOOOOOOO, if u want to edit the FFilessss pls edit it in ur own device and dont push up iTTT unless everyone agrees :) /./././.

### Future PDO Settings

The prepared connection helper is:

```text
api/config.php
```

Default XAMPP settings:

- Host: `localhost`
- Database: `astrohealth`
- Username: `root`
- Password: empty string

The helper logs detailed PDO errors on the server and returns only generic database-unavailable messages to the frontend. This avoids exposing raw database errors during future API work.

## Cleanup Notes

The requested duplicate copy files for `index.html` and `style.css` were checked. They are not present in the current project folder, so no duplicate files were removed.

## Team Notes

- Keep `data-schema.json` as the shared source of truth until a database is added.
- Do not change API response formats casually; the frontend depends on stable JSON keys.
- Add MySQL only when the team is ready to store real users, missions, telemetry history, or AI logs.
- Add real AI only after the placeholder contracts are accepted by the team.
